# Exercism F# Exercises
[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/blutack/exercism_fsharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blutack/exercism_fsharp)

Just so I don't loose track of them if [Exercism](http://exercism.io) disappears.

Requires dotnet core.

To run the test suites for the samples, change directory into one of the exercises and run:
```bash
$ dotnet test
```
